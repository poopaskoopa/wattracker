# Multi-agent working agreement

Two agents work on this repo concurrently (a Claude Code session and another
agent in a separate terminal). These rules exist because we have already had
three incidents from violating them: entangled uncommitted trees, a stale
server process wiping a migrated live DB, and — on 2026-08-13 — a rebase onto
a stale `origin/main` that force-pushed away three merged security fixes, a
test file and a tracked document.

The third incident is why the two rules below are stated as loudly as they
are. Nothing about that work was wrong except its base: `origin/main` in that
clone was 22 hours old.

## Fetch before you rebase or branch

```sh
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main
```

Not `git rebase origin/main` on its own. A remote-tracking ref is a cache; it
is only as current as your last fetch. Rebasing onto a stale `origin/main`
silently replays an old lineage and drops everything that landed in between,
and the result looks like a clean rebase.

Before pushing a branch someone else may have touched, confirm the remote is
where you think it is:

```sh
git fetch origin && git log --oneline origin/<branch> -1
```

## Branch ownership is exclusive

A branch has exactly one owner: whoever created it. **Nobody else pushes to
it — including the integrator.**

If the integrator needs to change another agent's branch, they cut their own
branch from it and open a PR, or they ask the owner. Rewriting someone else's
branch is how reviewed work gets destroyed: the second agent's own history is
not visible to the pusher, so a force-push cannot be checked against it.

`--force-with-lease=<branch>:<sha>` against an explicitly stated SHA, never a
bare `--force`. If the lease fails, stop and look — do not retry harder.

A `pre-push` hook backing this up ships in `scripts/hooks/`. Install it in
every clone, first thing:

```sh
scripts/hooks/install.sh
```

It refuses direct pushes to `main`, and it refuses a rewrite of a shared
branch that would drop remote work with no counterpart here — naming the
commits it would have stranded. A rebase is not such a rewrite: replaying your
own commits onto merged `main` loses nothing, and the hook lets it through.

It judges by patch content, and that is not the same as identity. It can miss
a remote commit whose changes exist here under a different author or message,
and it does not look inside merge commits, so a conflict resolution recorded
only in one is not seen. In the other direction, an amend or a squash of your
own commits will trip it; read the list it prints, and if the work is already
in what you are pushing, `--no-verify` is the intended answer.

The hook cannot check the lease. Git hands `pre-push` only ref names and
shas on stdin, never the command line, so `--force-with-lease` is invisible to
it and stays a convention you keep rather than a rule it enforces. It judges
the shas instead, which catches the same mistake from the other end.

It is a guardrail against an honest mistake, not a control — `--no-verify`
bypasses it, and that is fine, because the failure being prevented is a
reflex, not an adversary. PR merges go through the GitHub API and are
unaffected.

## Never name a branch after a closed issue

Once an issue's work is merged, its branch is dead. Anything re-derived from
that branch's original base re-adds commits that already landed, which is how
`agent2/issue59` produced add/add conflicts against `main` twice while
carrying a feature that had nothing to do with issue #59.

Name a branch for the work it carries, and cut it from current `main`.

## Worktrees — never share a checkout

- **Integrator (Claude session):** the primary checkout, branch `main`.
- **Second agent:** a separate linked worktree (e.g. `../wattracker-agent2`),
  branch `agent2/work` (or `agent2/<feature>` branches cut from `main`).
- Never edit files in the other agent's worktree. Never leave work-in-progress
  in a tree you don't own.

## Commit identity — set this in every clone and worktree, first thing

This repo is **private**, but its history was deliberately rewritten once to
strip the owner's personal identity — so treat every commit as if it will be
published, because making the repo public must not re-expose the address.
The machine's *global* git config still
carries a personal address, so any clone that doesn't override it locally
re-publishes that address in every commit. This has already happened once.

**Use a distinct name per agent, and a noreply address always.** Both agents
authenticate to GitHub as the same account, so the commit *name* is the only
thing that says who did the work. When every clone committed as
`wattrackerboss`, identifying which agent force-pushed a branch required
finding the other clone's reflog on disk — the account, the PR author and the
commit metadata were all identical.

Run inside each clone/worktree, before your first commit:

```sh
# integrator / primary checkout
git config user.name  wattrackerboss
git config user.email wattrackerboss@users.noreply.github.com

# second agent's clone
git config user.name  codex
git config user.email codex@users.noreply.github.com

git config user.email   # verify — must print a noreply address
```

The email must always be a `@users.noreply.github.com` address. The name is
free to differ and should.

Repo-local on purpose; do not touch the global config. Before pushing, check
your unmerged commits:

```sh
git log --format='%h %an <%ae> | %cn <%ce>' origin/main..HEAD
```

If any commit shows a personal address, fix it *before* it reaches `main` —
`git rebase origin/main --exec 'git commit --amend --no-edit --reset-author'`
— then force-push your `agent2/*` branch. Never rewrite commits already on
`main`.

## Integration

- Only the integrator pushes to `main`. The second agent commits to its
  `agent2/*` branch, pushes it, and reports "ready to merge".
- Before any merge to `main`: full suite green — `.venv/bin/python -m pytest`
  (run from the repo root; the venv lives in the main worktree).
- Rebase `agent2/*` on `main` before handing off if `main` has moved.

## Schema changes (serialize these)

- `SCHEMA_VERSION` in `wattracker/db.py` and the `_MIGRATIONS` chain are a
  shared sequence. Two branches must never both introduce the same version
  number. Announce a bump before starting it; if `main` gains a version while
  your branch is in flight, renumber yours on rebase.
- Migrations are in-place (`ALTER`/`CREATE`), never drop/recreate.

## Live server and live DB (single owner: the integrator)

- Live data: `~/.wattracker/wattracker.db`. Only the integrator migrates it,
  restarts the server (`./scripts/restart.sh`), or writes to it.
- The second agent tests against a scratch DB in a temp dir — never against
  `~/.wattracker`.
- Restart protocol (integrator only): back up the live DB, kill **every**
  running server process (old code holding a stale schema in memory has wiped
  the DB before), then start from pushed `main` only — never from a tree with
  uncommitted schema changes.

## The work queue — take the top unblocked item

Pick work from this list, top down. Do not pick by interest, and do not start
something not on it without saying so first. The order is not arbitrary:
each entry says what it unblocks, and taking them out of order produces
branches that cannot be verified or merged.

The list gives the **order**. GitHub gives the **state** — always
`gh issue view <n>` before starting, because an issue's body gets amended
(#234's scope grew a whole section after it was filed) and its labels move.
If the two disagree, GitHub wins and the queue is stale; say so.

1. **#249 — rotating full-suite test flakes.** The top item and the only one
   that makes every other item's green run trustworthy. 1 to 4 failures per
   full run, a *different* test each time, each one green in isolation **and**
   under heavy synthetic CPU load — so it is not a timing race.
   **Substantially narrowed on 2026-09-07.** Four hypotheses are dead: leaked
   export/ride writers, `httpx2`, the starlette version gap, and
   `cookie_secure`. The mechanism is identified — the session goes missing
   mid-test, `AuthMiddleware` 303s to `/welcome`, `TestClient` follows it, and
   the assertion reads a 200 of the wrong page. What is *not* established is
   why the session goes missing. **PR #261 (merged 2026-09-09, `9fb8169b`)
   acted on the most promising lead** — the four implicated `_register()`
   helpers now assert the 303 and probe an authenticated endpoint, so a lost
   session fails as "registration did not leave an authenticated session"
   instead of as a misleading assertion three lines later. It also stopped an
   exported `WATTRACKER_COOKIE_SECURE` breaking the suite (85 failed before,
   107 passed after). **That was diagnostic only and #249 is still open.** The
   next step is to run full suites until an instance fires and read what the
   new assertion says — the instrumentation is in place, the root cause is
   not. 37 other files still have `_register` helpers that discard their
   response; sweep them once the cause is known, not before. **PR #265 (merged
   2026-09-10) closed off the ambient-environment class of cause entirely**:
   `conftest.isolated_env` now clears ten more variables the app reads, and
   `tests/test_env_isolation.py` fails if a new `os.environ.get` in the app is
   neither isolated nor exempted with a reason. A surviving flake is therefore
   not the developer's shell leaking in. Fully local, no hardware, no
   deployment.
2. **#258 — iOS: read the local desktop server as a second backend.**
   **Unblocked on 2026-09-09** when #256 merged; the `blocked` label is off and
   GitHub now has it `ready`. It waited on #256 because the protocol extraction
   touches the same screen files. Order: extract the read protocol behind
   `CloudClient` / `CloudSession` / `SnapshotCache` as one behaviour-preserving
   refactor, then add the local adapter. Transport is settled — see #192: TLS in
   front of the local server, terminator the rider's choice, not publicly
   reachable.

**Done since this list was last written.** The iOS screens all landed:
**#161 as PR #253**, **#162 as PR #254** (both re-applied onto `main`'s
session; PRs #228 and #235 are closed as superseded) and **#163 as PR #256**
(merged 2026-09-09) — `fac4836` fixed the review's one correctness bug, where
`VolumeData.previousWeeks` compared a full current window against a clamped
prior one and `change()` reported e.g. +300% for a flat 5 h/week rider, and the
two performance items, with tests. **#193 landed as PR
#257** (`6830150a`) — the repository now has an `android/` tree. #234 merged
as PR #240 after an on-device run; #233 landed in PR #238; #217's
credential-free half landed in PR #239, its remainder gated on #102. #167 was
closed 2026-09-05.

**Pairing is wired on `main`.** `CloudClient.pair(code:)` →
`SessionGate.pair(code:label:)` → `PairingScreen`. The section below about
#162 and #163 waiting for pairing describes a gap that no longer exists.

**The iOS app can be run against a real server on a device.**
`scripts/walking_skeleton_server.py --lan` enrols a writer, publishes a full
snapshot, mints pairing codes and writes the Mac's LAN address to
`ios/WatTracker/Config/Local.xcconfig`. `docs/ios-device-validation.md` is the
checklist and carries the traps — a 900-second code, and remints that wipe the
in-memory store along with the revoked-device record.

**Do not start #161, #162, #163 or #247.** All four are open *only* for an
on-device check, which no agent can perform. Their screens are on `main`.
Starting one re-implements code that already exists — the `agent:codex` labels
that used to point here were removed on 2026-09-09 for that reason. #163 joined
them when PR #256 merged: what is left of it is its done-criterion "both screens
match the desktop's numbers for the same rider and period", which is a rider
holding a device, not a test run.

**Do not start #169** without asking; it is `blocked`. #242 is `blocked` on
#102 and is a measurement of a live deployment, not code. **#217** needs a
real deployment; its body's claims about `containerized` being parked and
`Dockerfile.cloud` never being built are both stale.

3. **#264 — one device-validation procedure for iOS and Android.** Unassigned
   and cross-cutting: the harness, both clients, and the validation doc.
   Android has no on-device path at all today. Ask before taking it — it
   spans both epics and its Android half is taksmon's territory.

**The Android epic (#192-#199, plus #259 and #260) is taksmon's** by GitHub
assignee and is not on this queue.

**One iOS issue at a time.** `project.pbxproj` conflicts on almost every
concurrent edit — see `docs/agent-workflow.md` §4. This is why #258 waited for
#256 rather than running alongside it.

### Before starting any iOS issue that already has a PR

Diff the existing PR's files against `main` **two-dot** (`git diff
origin/main <ref>`), not three-dot. A three-dot diff measures from the merge
base, so on a stale branch it presents already-merged work as new. PR #235 was
opened carrying an `api.py` change and 83 test lines that had merged three and
a half hours earlier as PR #237 (`9e1b3d2`); a two-dot diff against `main` is
empty for those files and would have caught it immediately.

PR #235 also re-implements the actor-reentrancy fix that PR #228 already
contains, under a different name — `sessionGeneration` against #228's
`lifecycleGeneration`, each with its own `refreshTaskID`. The two conflict on
`CloudSession.swift` and it is not a rebase conflict: whichever lands second
must drop its own counter and adopt the other's, then re-verify its reads.
Keep #228's, which was reviewed line by line. Two generation counters guarding
one actor is not a merge, it is a bug.

Both PRs are now closed — #253 and #254 re-applied that work onto `main`
instead. The two-dot rule above is the part to carry forward; the #235/#228
collision is kept as the worked example of why it matters.

### Say whether you ran it on a device

This section used to explain why #162 and #163 were held back: nothing in the
app target called `CloudSession.pair(code:)`, so the keychain was never
written and every screen rendered its empty state on a device. **That gap is
closed** — pairing is wired on `main` (`CloudClient.pair` → `SessionGate.pair`
→ `PairingScreen`) and #234 landed the harness to pair against.

The rule that outlived it: a screen that passes CI has not been shown to work.
Green `ios-tests` cannot see an unreachable screen, and it could not see the
sideways QR preview a device run caught on 2026-09-06. **If you build a
screen, say plainly whether you ran it on a device or only in CI.** That
disclosure is what lets the review catch what the tests cannot — and it is why
#161, #162 and #247 stay open after their code has merged.

### When an issue's premise has gone stale

Issue bodies are written at a point in time and `main` moves. #217 says the
`containerized` job is `parked at if: ${{ false }}` and that
`Dockerfile.cloud` "has never been built anywhere" — both were true when it
was filed and neither is true now: that job runs on `ubuntu-latest` on every
PR and already builds the image and verifies the `cloud` extra imports inside
it. #102 argues at length against an APIM cost that #213 removed from
`main.bicep` entirely.

So: **check the claims an issue rests on before implementing against them.**
When one has gone stale, say so in the PR description and scope to what is
actually left. Do not silently redo work that has landed, and do not invent
replacement scope to fill the gap — a smaller PR that says why it is smaller
is the right outcome.

### Finishing an item

- Report **"ready to merge"** and stop. Only the integrator merges, and only
  the integrator pushes to `main`.
- Say plainly what you could not verify. "Simulator execution unavailable in
  this environment" on #228 was the right disclosure and it is what let the
  review catch that the screen is unreachable on a device.
- If the PR does not close its issue, say so in the description and why —
  #219 did this correctly against #217.
- Do not start the next item while your PR is unreviewed *if* the next item
  touches the same files. Otherwise carry on; note the dependency in the PR.

## Scope

- Partition by feature, not by file. Cross-branch edits to shared modules
  (`db.py`, `server.py`) are fine — git merges them; simultaneous edits to one
  tree are not.
